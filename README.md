# Hotel-Reservation-System
This is a simple Bash script for managing hotel room reservations. The script allows you to add, remove, and list reservations, as well as print bills for customers. There is also a text file that acts as a simple database to store reservation details. Each line in the file represents a reservation with the following fields separated by a pipe ('|') character.
